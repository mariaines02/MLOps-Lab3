# We explicitly copy results/ in Dockerfile, but usually we ignore it. 
# However, since we need the model artifacts, we should NOT ignore results/ 
# OR we should ignore it and rely on the COPY instruction if the context includes it.
# Docker COPY respects .dockerignore. 
# So we must NOT ignore results/ if we want to COPY it.
# But we might want to ignore other large files.
